# Manager README
Manager README for people working with Magnus Hedemark, currently a leader in Enterprise Architecture at [Optum](https://github.com/optum), a [UnitedHealth Group](http://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/) company.

## Why this README?
People are not resources. We're messy, imperfect, full of deviations from the mythological "normal". This README is an effort to help people to understand me, to understand my strengths and weaknesses, and my expectations of others. As well, we'll talk about what you can expect from me.
